## **Initial ERD**

## **Models**

- **User:**

- **Profile:**
  - has a belongs_to :user relatioinship, because you need to have a user to create a profile.
  - has a has_many :reviews relationship because, a profile can leave maby reviews for different listings
  - has a has_one_attached :avatar polymorphic relationship, which means that a profile can upload a profile photo
  - has a has_many :photographs_to_buy relationship beacuse each profile can buy many photographs. It also has a classname of listing, as it is associated with the listing table and the foreignkey buyer_id
  - has a has_many :photographs_to_sell, class_name: "Listing", foreign_key: "seller_id", because each profile can sell many drone photographs. It also has a classname of listing, as it is associated with the listing table and the foreignkey seller_id
- **Listing:**
  - has a belongs_to :buyer, class_name: "Profile", optional: true because it is associated with the profile table. The optional tag is added because the listing may not have a buyer yet.
  - belongs_to :seller, class_name: "Profile" because it is associated with the profile table as a seller. Here it is not optional, as the listing must always have a seller.
- **Review:**

## **Database relations**

- For the database relations the first table is users table that entails the attributes id as PK(which is automatically assigned when generating a table), email and password for users to be authenticated.
- Following the user table, a profiles table was created to store more details information about the user including an id, username, first_name, last_name, bio:text, homebase, and user:references, which is a FK that leads bacl to the user table.
- The listings table entails the most information and most complex realtions with a self join. It has an id, title, description, date_taken:date, category, available, price:float, profile:references, seller_id:integer, and buyer_id:integer
- Reviews table has an id, rating:integer, comment:description, listing:references, and profile:references as it will belong to the profile id of the user that writes the review and belong to the listing id it is reviewing.
- Active_storage_blobs and Active_storage_attachments and which is generated via rails active_storage:install.
